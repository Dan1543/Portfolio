# Hello, I'm Jesus Daniel.

I am a Computer Engineer bridging the gap between **Embedded Systems** and **Data Science**.

I build systems that not only capture data but understand it. With proficiency in **C** and **Python**, I focus on creating end-to-end solutions—from the microcontroller to the data analysis.

## My Focus Areas
* **Embedded Engineering:** C, Hardware integration.
* **Data Science:** Python, Data analysis, automation, data mining.

## Featured Projects
* **Weather Station:** An IoT system leveraging ESP32 and Python to capture environmental data (temperature, humidity, pressure). Data flows through **AWS IoT Core** to **DynamoDB** for storage, then processed via **Lambda** functions to generate weather predictions for end users.
